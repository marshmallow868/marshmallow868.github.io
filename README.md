# Mullet - Portfolio

This is the source code for my personal website. I built it to be a fast, clean, and minimalist hub where I can showcase my projects and my focus on native macOS development and system-level programming.

## The Approach
I wanted a site that reflects my development philosophy: **performance and attention to detail**. Instead of heavy frameworks or bloated templates, I used a lean stack to keep the site lightning-fast and easy to maintain.

- **Native Feel**: Dark-themed UI with smooth gradients, designed to align with a modern macOS aesthetic.
- **Pure Tech**: Written in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No overhead, just the code I actually need.
- **Project Focus**: Built specifically to highlight my work on tools like `hashcore` and `Hash Manager`.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML**: Structured for clarity and accessibility.
- **CSS**: Custom layout and styling, featuring a modern aesthetic and responsive design for mobile.

## Selected Work Featured
- **hashcore**: A C-compatible shared library for xxHash64, optimized for macOS.
- **Hash Manager**: A native macOS frontend built to interface with my Rust libraries.
