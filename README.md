## Development Philosophy

The architecture of this project is governed by principles of performance and minimalism. To align with a system-level development background, the implementation avoids high-level frameworks and heavy dependencies in favor of a lean, native-first approach.

* **Performance-First**: Optimized for rapid load times and minimal browser overhead.
* **Design Language**: A dark-themed interface utilizing modern macOS aesthetics, including high-fidelity gradients and responsive typography.
* **Vanilla Implementation**: Built using standard web technologies to ensure long-term maintainability and compliance with web standards.

## Project Highlights

The portfolio is structured to provide technical visibility for the following specialized software:

#### 1. hvv-monitor-web
Browser-based HVV departure board and route planner. It features real-time data, transit-specific color coding, and modes for interactive searching, fixed-position monitoring, and journey planning.

#### 2. Hash Manager
SwiftUI-based macOS frontend for the hashcore Rust library that manages xxHash64 integrity verification across large batches. It provides a native interface for automated change detection and progress tracking.
