                <b>Meteroite Alarm - <font color="green">Finished</font></b>
                <p>
                    Meteorite-Alarm was the first game I've ever made when I was 10 years old. It was in a workshop that my mother booked for me. It was the first time I've ever coded something. I ended the project in Early 2024. I know it's long for such a game but I took long breaks in between for personal reasons. It's a simple javascript game with a spaceship that has to avoid meteorites. The spaceship is controlled by WASD.

                <b>My first website - <font color="green">Finished</font></b>
                <p>
                    This was the first website I've ever made. I coded it in an informatic working-group with my mentor in Early 2022. It was just a small project so it's not that good. There used to be links to my friends websites but i can't find them and I doubt that they are still online. There is also the old version of "Meteorite-Alarm" on it. It could be interesting to see how it looked like in the past (little tip: you control the spaceship with the arrow keys here).

                <b>My first website, remastered - <font color="green">Finished</font></b>
                <p>
                    This is just a remastered version of my first website that you can look at above. I updated it in 2025 to make it look more of an old retro site and didn't change the main components. One change is that you now can play a Hangman-game I made years ago. It's not important enough to show it here but I think it's fun. On it there is also a link to the new version of Meteroite-Alarm other than the old version before it.

                <b>Better Minecraft - <font color="orange">In Progress...</font></b>
                <p>
                    Better Minecraft is a game I started in Early 2024 to quickly refresh my knowledge about HTML, JavaScript and CSS, because of our informatics-lessons in school. It slowly got a bigger project than expected so it's not finished yet but I can't find time to finish it. Maybe you will be able to play it in like 2 years. In the game you have a player that you can control by WASD. I'm planning to make it an infinitely generated world.

                <b>Planet B - <font color="orange">In Progress...</font></b>
                <p>
                    Planet B is a colonization game where you start of on a planet which you have to colonize. You will be able to build your empire and take on new planets and solar systems. It's a clone of Planet S which isn't that big but it's a cool game for everyone that wants to try it. You can download it for free on Steam and also join the discord server. There nothing more to say as the game is still in very early developing.

                <b>Game of Life - <font color="green">Finished</font></b>
                <p>
                    Game of Life is a clone of the original John Conway's Game of Life. Game of Life was developed in 1970 from John Conway and it's about drawing structures that live and react to each other. It's pretty simple but you can build enormous things. Like I said it's not my game and I just tried to make it in JavaScript. It took me like 2 days to code it so don't mind when there are still some bugs i didn't want to fix.
